        <p>
            It all started in Birmingham, AL where I was born and raised on the playground is where I spent most of my days chilling out maxing and relaxing and shooting some B-Ball outside of the school when a couple of guys were up to no good started making trouble in my neighboor. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared and your moving to uncle and aunties' in Florida. I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 and yelled to the cabbie you homes smell ya later and looked at my kingdom I was finally there to taste all the tastes of my new home in Belliar.
